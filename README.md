# React + Vite Application

This template provides a minimal setup to get a sample React application setup with Vite, ESLint, Prettier, and Husky for pre-commit hooks

# Running Locally

This assumes you have NodeJS installed on your machine.

1. Run an `npm install` to install all packages.
2. Run an `npm run prepare` to initialize Husky for pre-commit hooks.
3. Run an `npm run start` to run the application locally. Enjoy!
